  * Switching from high to med TV promotional budget reduces sales by $75 million (95\% CI \[-82 -68\])<br>
  * Switching from high to low TV promotional budget reduces sales by $154 million (95\% CI \[-164 -145\])<br>
  * Radio has a positive coefficient of 2.97. i.e. Sales increases $3 million per $\$1$ million promotion in Radio.<br>
<br>
