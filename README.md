# project-marketing-promotion

## Overview<br>
  Analyze a historical marketing promotion data to propose cost effective marketing promotion(s)<br>
  Conduct a multiple linear regression analysis to estimate sales from a combination of independent variables<br>
<br>
## Objective<br>
  Advise stakeholders the cost effective marketing promotion<br>
<br>
## Verification of assumptions<br>
![graph 1](/assets/graph_1.png)![graph 2](/assets/graph_2.png)<br>
![graph 3](/assets/graph_3.png)<br>
  All five assumptions are valid to use multiple linear regression<br> 
  (Linearity, Independence, Normality, Constant variance, Multicolinearity)<br>
<br>
## Result<br>
![table_1](/assets/table_1.png)<br>
  * Switching from high to med TV promotional budget reduces sales by $75 million (95\% CI \[-82 -68\])<br>
  * Switching from high to low TV promotional budget reduces sales by $154 million (95\% CI \[-164 -145\])<br>
  * Radio has a positive coefficient of 2.97. i.e. Sales increases $3 million per $\$1$ million promotion in Radio.<br>
<br>
Therefore, clarify high TV promotion cost and then determine which is cost effective, either TV or Radio per $1 million investment
